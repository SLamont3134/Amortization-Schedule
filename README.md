# Amortization-Schedule
This function produces an amortization schedule. It shows hows to space text in C into tables. 
It also shows calculations, saving and manipulationg variables. No user input is requested per the instructions, 
instead the variable values are hard coded. To make this an interactive program would only require a few lines 
with a scanner.
